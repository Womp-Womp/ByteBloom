PRD & Readme: ByteBloom Gardens
1. Vision & Overview

Project Title: ByteBloom Gardens: A Command-Line Agricultural Simulation

Elevator Pitch: ByteBloom Gardens is a deeply simulated, terminal-based gardening and economics game. Players manage virtual land, cultivate a vast array of procedurally-generated plants, and navigate a dynamic, event-driven economy. It's SimCity meets Stardew Valley, all within the elegance and scriptability of the command line.

Core Fantasy: To be a master digital horticulturalist and economic magnate, optimizing complex systems for maximum profit and prestige, all from the comfort of your terminal.

Target Audience: Programmers, SysAdmins, tinkerers, and players who love deep simulation, strategy games, and automation.

2. Core Gameplay Loop

The gameplay is a continuous cycle of strategy, execution, and reaction:

Acquire & Prepare: Purchase plots of land. Analyze and amend soil (pH, nutrients, moisture).

Plant & Cultivate: Plant seeds at specific coordinates. Nurture them by watering, applying fertilizers/pesticides, and trimming.

Monitor & Protect: Watch for environmental changes (weather), pests, and disease. Use tools and automated systems to react.

Harvest & Store: Harvest mature plants for yield. Store them in silos or warehouses.

Analyze & Sell: Track market prices and news events. Sell produce at the opportune moment for maximum profit.

Invest & Expand: Use profits to buy more land, research new plant genetics, upgrade tools, and invest in the in-game stock market.

Repeat: The cycle continues, with increasing complexity, scale, and automation challenges.

3. Detailed Feature Breakdown
3.1. The Garden: Your Digital Acre

Grid-Based System: The world is a large 2D grid. The player owns one or more rectangular "plots" within this grid.

Coordinate System: Every cell has an (X, Y) coordinate. All actions target coordinates (e.g., plant 12,34 --seed=tomato).

Rich Soil Simulation: Each cell has properties:

Soil Type: Sand, Clay, Loam, etc. (Affects water retention and nutrient levels).

Moisture Level: From parched to flooded. Changes with watering and weather.

Nutrients: N-P-K (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) levels. Depleted by plants, replenished by fertilizers.

pH Level: Acidity/Alkalinity. Affects nutrient uptake for different plants.

Weed Pressure: A background value that determines the random chance of weeds spawning.

3.2. Botany & Plant Simulation

Vast Plant Variety: Hundreds of possible plants with different properties.

Procedural Plant Genetics: A plant isn't just a "Tomato." It's an instance of a species with genetic traits:

growth_time: Ticks until maturity.

yield_range: [min, max] units produced.

water_req: Ideal moisture range.

nutrient_drain: NPK usage per tick.

light_req: Required sun exposure.

pest_resistance: Chance to resist specific pests.

disease_resistance: Chance to resist specific diseases.

genetic_stability: Chance of mutation when collecting seeds.

Life Cycle: Seeded -> Sprout -> Growing -> Mature -> Fruiting -> Withering.

Pests, Weeds, and Diseases:

Can appear based on game events, weather, and plot conditions.

Spread to adjacent tiles (a perfect use for convolution-like logic).

Have specific counters (e.g., "Aphids" countered by "Ladybug" pesticide).

3.3. Economics & Market Simulation

Dynamic Commodity Market: The price of each crop (e.g., "Wheat," "Strawberries") fluctuates.

Price Influencers:

Supply & Demand: Player selling a large batch of tomatoes will temporarily crash the tomato price.

Random Walks: A base level of market volatility.

Game Events: See section 3.4. A news event about a drought will increase the price of water-intensive crops.

The "ByteBloom AgroCorp" (BBA) Stock:

An in-game stock that players can buy and sell.

Its value is tied to the overall health of the game's economy and influenced by major game events.

Player success can indirectly boost the stock's value over time.

3.4. The World: Events & Information

The "Terminal Ticker" / "ASCII Chronicle": An AI-generated newspaper/news ticker.

It is not random flavor text; it reports on actual in-game events.

EVENT: Blight fungus detected in player plots. -> TICKER: "Fungus Among Us! Crimson Blight threatens local harvests! Experts recommend immediate fungicidal treatment."

EVENT: Player sells 10,000 units of corn. -> TICKER: "Corn prices plummet following massive harvest sale. BBA stock dips slightly."

Weather System: A simulated weather forecast (e.g., "Sunny," "Rainy," "Heatwave," "First Frost").

Directly impacts soil moisture, plant growth rates, and can trigger events like "Drought" or "Flood".

3.5. Player Progression & Tools

Experience & Skills: Earn XP for harvesting, making profit, etc. Level up to unlock skills in:

Botany: Unlock new plant species, access genetic modification tools.

Economics: Get better price information, lower transaction fees.

Engineering: Unlock automated tools.

Achievements: Dozens of achievements to reward milestones (First Million, Survive a Blight, Automate 100 tiles).

Tools & Automation:

Manual Tools: watering_can, hoe, pesticide_sprayer.

Automated Tools:

Sprinklers: Automatically water an area to maintain a target moisture level.

Auto-Harvesters: Fleets of drones that can be commanded to harvest all mature plants in a given plot or coordinate range (harvest --plot=A --type=mature).

Diagnostic Drones: Scan an area and report back on soil health or disease presence.

Scripting: The ultimate tool. The game's CLI should be robust enough to allow players to write their own bash or python scripts to automate their entire farm.

3.6. Persistence & State

Auto-Save: The game state should be saved automatically at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes or every 100 game ticks).

Manual Save/Load: Commands to explicitly save the game to a named slot (save my-perfect-farm) and load it.

State Format: The game state will be serialized to a file. A well-structured format like JSON is human-readable, but a binary format or a simple SQLite database could be more performant and robust for complex queries.

4. Technology Stack Recommendation

Given the project complexity, the CLI-nature, and the AI-driven development model ("Jules"), the technology choice is critical.

The Analysis

C++: Not Recommended. The risk of manual memory management errors (leaks, dangling pointers) is too high for an AI-generated codebase of this complexity. Debugging would be a nightmare.

Python: Good for Scripting, Risky for Core. Excellent for writing automation scripts to control the game, but the core engine would suffer from performance issues (GIL, interpreted nature) during heavy simulation. Dynamic typing is also a liability, as the AI could generate type-inconsistent code that only fails at runtime.

JS/TypeScript: Viable, but not ideal. TypeScript provides strong typing, which is a huge plus. The Node.js ecosystem is massive. However, performance for a CPU-intensive, stateful simulation on a single thread could become a bottleneck. It's more suited to I/O-bound tasks.

Top Recommendations:

Rust (Strongly Recommended)

Pros:

Safety: The compiler's borrow checker eliminates entire classes of bugs (memory safety, data races). This is the single biggest advantage when working with an AI coder. The compiler acts as a strict, logical partner.

Performance: C-level speed, zero-cost abstractions. Perfect for heavy simulations.

Amazing Tooling: cargo is best-in-class for package management and building. clippy for linting. rustfmt for formatting. This enforces consistency on the AI's output.

Rich Ecosystem: Excellent libraries for the task: clap or argh for parsing CLI arguments, ratatui or crossterm for the ASCII interface, serde for foolproof serialization (JSON, etc.), rusqlite for database storage.

Expressive Type System: Enums and Traits make modeling complex game states (like PlantState or PestType) elegant and safe.

Cons:

Steep learning curve (for humans, maybe less so for an AI).

Compile times can be longer than Go.

Go (Excellent Alternative)

Pros:

Simplicity: A small language spec means it's easy for the AI to generate correct, idiomatic code.

Performance: Very fast, compiled binary.

Concurrency: Built-in goroutines would be fantastic for running the market simulation, weather updates, and plant growth in the background without freezing the UI.

Fast Compilation: Quick iteration cycles.

Cons:

Error handling is verbose (if err != nil), which might clutter AI-generated code.

The type system is less expressive than Rust's, making it harder to model some game states with compile-time guarantees.

TUI library ecosystem is good but arguably less mature than Rust's.

Final Decision: Use Rust.

The safety guarantees provided by the Rust compiler are the ultimate "guardrails" for an AI development partner like Jules. It will prevent subtle, hard-to-find bugs and enforce a high degree of correctness from the very beginning.

6. Command-Line API (Examples)

This is what the player would type. The bbg alias is for bytebloom-gardens.

Generated bash
# Start a new game, save it immediately
bbg new --name="My First Farm"
bbg save my_first_farm

# View a section of the grid
bbg view --from=0,0 --to=10,10

# Plant some things
bbg plant 1,1 --seed=potato
bbg plant 1,2 --seed=corn
bbg plant 1,3 --seed=corn

# Water a single tile, or a whole row using a script
bbg water 1,1
for i in {1..10}; do bbg water 1,$i; done

# Get a diagnostic report for a plot
bbg diag --plot=A --mode=pest

# See the market prices and news
bbg market view
bbg news

# Sell all your corn
bbg market sell --item=corn --amount=all

# Harvest an entire area of mature plants
bbg harvest --from=1,1 --to=10,10 --filter=mature
